            <h3>
              Hello, My name is Alex Jang, a senior at
              <a href="https://www.babson.edu">Babson College</a>, concentrating
              in Entrepreneurship. I’m planning to graduate this December.
              Although I’m an entrepreneurship concentrator, I have decided to
              study accounting outside of
              <a href="https://www.babson.edu">Babson College</a> after taking a
              leave of absence.
            </h3>
            <p>
              I became really passionate about accounting during the summer of
              2019 where I had the opportunity to work as a deals intern at PwC
              for transaction services. It was my first time working for an
              accounting firm, and I truly enjoyed working with other accounting
              professionals and industry experts. During the first two years in
              my college, as an entrepreneur, I wanted to explore diverse areas
              of interest from IT, hotel industry, and sports management.
              However, even after experiencing these industries throughout my
              internship, I still could not identify where my true passion lied,
              until I went to intern at an accounting firm. As an investor who
              invests in many companies, I had a chance to get familiar with 10k
              and 10q reports and it was always interesting to learn company
              financials and how they are performing in their business. I found
              out that it would be truly meaningful if I can be part of an
              accounting firm and contribute my talent in accounting to serve
              the other investors by producing accurate and high-quality
              accounting report. Then I had a clear goal of becoming an auditor,
              so I took accounting classes to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam, and
              I’m proud to say I passed the exam during the leave. Throughout
              the process, I was humbled, thrived off challenges and I was
              hungry to learn and to be pushed out of my comfort zone. There
              were some times I felt frustrated and discouraged because it was
              so demanding and difficult, yet I still didn’t stop and pushed me
              forward. It has been one of my best growth experiences and I
              believe it was the best gift I could have given myself. Apart from
              career, I am a very active person who love sports and traveling
              around the world.
